## Declaring an “Inspection” on the previous player

When an inspection is declared. Turn all of the cards on the table face up. If the total number is lower than the number that the previous player declared the inspection is successful. The previous player recieves a red card. If the total number is greater than the number that previous player declared then the inspection fails. The player who declared the inspection recieves a red card. Regardless of the outcome the round comes to an end and a new round begins.

When “30” is declared

When a player declares 30, all cards on the table are turned face up. If the total of these cards is greater than 30, the player declaring 30 wins the game (not the round). All other players lose. If the total is less than 30 the player that declared 30 recieves a red card and the round ends.
