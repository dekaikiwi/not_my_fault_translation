### Draw and place a card from the pile. Update the total.

Firstly pull the top card off the deck. While not revealing the value of the card to players, check the number then place it face down in front of you.

Next announce the the value of your card. Then update the value on the milestone card. You must declare a higher number than the previous player.

Additionally the only numbers you can declare without restriction are the numbers in the black squares  on the mule stone card. If you declare a number outside of these numbers you must turn your yellow card face up. From this point onward you can only declare numbers in the black squares.
