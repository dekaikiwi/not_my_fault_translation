## Game Explanation

This is a game of lies. Draw a card from the deck and lay it face down, then state what the card is. The next person does the same thing then states the sum of the number and the previous number. The game repeats in this fashion.

If you think the person before you has lied, the say “Inspection”. If you get called out on a lie twice then you lose!
